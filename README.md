- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SnowStorm3535
 I'm here to learn more about Github and how it can help me.
I was recently burned by Dropbox and Google for unknowingly
What was being synced into my account. See I'm not very savvy 
with computers and smart phones. I'm a hands on tradesman that 
Never uses one at work. I'll be honest in saying I have a slight 
Porn addiction, and I am very concerned with my privacy. I hate
The feeling that somewhere my searches, my liked say fetishes are
Being stored and can hurt me down the road. I do not see porn as something 
Disgusting or wrong.
